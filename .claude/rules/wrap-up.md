When "wrap up" is triggered, do the following:
1. Review the entire session for learnings — bug fixes, gotchas, patterns, conventions, or debugging insights
2. Check the relevant rules files (`.claude/rules/move.md`, `.claude/rules/indexer.md`, `.claude/rules/scripts.md`) for existing content
3. Deduplicate: don't add anything already covered
4. **Propose** (don't write yet) a summary of what you'd add and to which file(s)
5. Wait for my approval before writing any changes
